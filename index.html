		<td>The River Kosi, also known as the Koshi, drains from the Himalayas and the southern slopes in Nepal for a total stretch of 453 miles. The river is also shared with India and China. The River is also known as ‘Sorrow of Bihar’ because of the suffering it causes when it floods destroying the economy of the region. People also link the river to spiritual powers alluding that its forceful nature is death’s sister that limits population growth. The river also provides fishing grounds and is a source of employment for the young people who live in the region and do fishing. However, due to the different channels that the river has, districts around it risk being submerged should it flood.</td>
